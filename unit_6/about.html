		<h3>About me </h3>

		<p>I wouldn’t call myself a photographer. I’m a mare photo enthusiast. If I was to describe my style I would call it a 'run and gun'. Usually when taking photos I’m on the move, rushing from one place to another with a very limited time to capture the subject. If I see something interesting I stop, take a picture, and move on. I never went, and probably never will go on a photo trip. It always cracks me up when I see people photographing a single waterfall for hours, using tripods, ND filters, remote release and photo gear that is probably worth more than the car I drive. All this just to post it on Facebook, where the quality is lost anyway. Moreover, I think that in today’s world people are too obsessed with shitty Instagram-like aesthetics with oversaturated colours or filters. I prefer it when a photo captures reality and is usable straight out of the camera. </p>
		<p> In my private life I also enjoy driving twisty roads and mountain passes, making scale models, electronic music, urbex, video games, cheap whisky and nature. I’m also a harsh noise 'musician' (artist sounds too fucking pretentious). You can check the stuff that I recorded with my friend Sadist here.</p>
		<p>Fuck. Why does it always suck to write about yourself?</p>
